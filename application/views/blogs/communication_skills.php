			<p>Communication skills are an important aspect of our everyday life. But sound communication skills require time and effort, which shall pay you back in many folds. Everytime you go for campus placements, you have to make them aware about yourself in a limited and short time. Among hundreds of candidates similar academic backgrounds, it ultimately ends with your prowess of your words. No, you need not be a top orator to be successful. But to be able to express in concise yet complete manner is the most important skill to have in today’s era. Where everything is becoming lightning fast, you have to keep up.<br><br> 
			So here are 10 important tips for your campus placements, that will help you in long run.</p>

			
			<ol>
  				<li><b>Keep calm and be composed</b></li>
  				<p>Before even going for any interview, you have to be composed and calm. Why? Because if you are in a constant state of panic, you start forgetting key points and end up fumbling. So start preparing well ahead and build the confidence. Remember, confidence is the key. Having clear ideas about what you want to speak is always a morale booster. Before entering the venue remember to take deep breaths, it helps your brain keep alert and function better.</p>
  				
  				<li>Start preparing well ahead</li>
  				<p>Many people fumble when faced a challenging situation. It’s natural. Most college students fumble because they start preparing late and try to cramp too much knowledge in a short period of time. So the brain is in a constant panic about what to remember and what not to! This, when facing the panel, becomes the issue. So start preparing well ahead. </p>
  				
  				<li>Practice out loud.</li>
  				<p>Many a times it happens so that even with a good preparation and confidence, we stutter or fumble. The main reason is we don’t speak often in formal settings. And as for first time interviewees, this is a daunting challenge. So practice speaking out loud. Practice in front of mirror, understand your shortcoming and improve accordingly.</p>
  				
  				<li>Increase Vocabulary.</li>
  				<p>Always try to keep many words at your disposal, you may forget the exact words while explaining, so instead of waiting for the word to come to your mind, go for the next best word. Even if you have a solid grasp of concepts, if you cannot explain properly, they wouldn’t see further.</p>
  				
  				<li>Body Language, keep it checked.</li>
  				<p>Body language is another thing that you must be very careful about. Interviewers not only sees your concepts but also how you present yourselves. Even with good speaking skills, a bad body language can ruin pretty good chances. Don’t be overtly exertive, be mild and be alert.</p>
  				
  				<li>Voice tones.</li>
  				<p>Pretty self explanatory but a crucial point. Don’t argue. Try to make your point calmly. Many a times, they test your patience and how do you handle situations where you are at a disadvantage. Keeping calm is always the skill they look for. Be vigilant. Don’t be too cool so as they infer disinterest from you.</p>
  				
  				<li>Communicate.</li>
  				<p>Always remember, interviews are not question answer sessions. They are communicating sessions. You have to communicate. Don’t sit idle while they are talking. Give suitable responses. Use nods, “hmm..”s,  “okay” to indicate your attention.</p>
  				
  				<li>Don’t be afraid.</li>
  				<p>Don’t be afraid to clarify your doubts. If you do not understand something they are saying, ask till it is clear. </p>
  				
  				<li>Think out loud.</li>
  				<p>Upon asking a question do not sit silently while you try to figure out the problem. They want to see what are you thinking. Say out loud what you are thinking. Don't be afraid to be wrong. This is the candid way to perfectly understand you thought process. Many a times they just look for your approach, not the solution itself. So, speak out loud.
				</p>
  				
  				<li>Analyze your past interviews.</li>
  				<p>After completing any interview, find your own shortcomings and work on them. This has to repeat. One cannot expect to be perfect in a single day. It’s an everyday process. Post-interview analysis is very important and prepares you for your next one even better.</p>
