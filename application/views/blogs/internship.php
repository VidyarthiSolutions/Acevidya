	<p><center><big>"You need experience to get experience.”</big></center>
  <br>This seems to be the biggest issue for young adults transitioning into the workforce these days.
	Employers in today’s labor market rely heavily on resumes that illustrate a relevant work history, whether that’s from internships, volunteer work, or actual job experience.
	A practical work background carries a major significance when attempting to enter the job market. It’s all about competition.
	Even your buddy who graduated with you in college has become your competition.
	Take a moment and think about it. If you’re looking to gain experience, working as an intern is arguably the most advantageous plan of action.
	That one internship you did over summer could be the difference between winning a job opportunity or losing it.</p>

    <ol>
    	<li>An Internship Provides Real Life Experience and Exposure</li>
    	<li>The Opportunity To Learn More About Yourself</li>
    	<li>Get Connected and Develop Your Professional Network</li>
    	<li>Prevent CV From Going To The Trash</li>
    	<li>Transition Into A Full-Time Position</li>
    </ol>


	<p>
	While you may get second chances when talking to someone face-to-face, your resume will not. Think of your resume as an extension of yourself and how you would want someone to perceive you.

	<p><b>The best student platforms such as indeed, glassdoor, internshala.</b></p>

	<p><b>How to get a good internship?</b></p>

	<p>It's one of the most common and frustrating career dilemmas college students face: "To get a good job after graduation, I need experience. But how do I get experience without having a job in the first place?"</p>
    
    <p>One common—and wise—solution: an internship, paid or unpaid, part-time or full-time.</p>

    <p><b>Work with a career counselor at your school</b></p>
    <p>Career counselors know where other students from your school are interning now or have interned before. They also work closely with on-campus recruiters from organizations in the area and even nationally. Thus, career counselors can be a prime source of internship leads for you</p>

    <p><b>Talk to your professors</b></p>
    <p>Like career counselors, your professors will also know where at least some students are interning now or have interned before. Additionally, many professors have consulting, research and other ties to various companies and organizations outside of academia; thus, they may be aware of internship programs hosted by these organizations</p>

    
    <p><b>Network with your fellow students</b></p>
    <p>If a student you know has an internship that intrigues you, ask him for advice on landing a similar internship yourself, either with the same organization or elsewhere. Chances are that students who have internships now have a better sense of the many internship opportunities that exist, in both their own organizations and in others. So be sure to tap into their collective knowledge, especially as it relates to people you should contact</p>

    <p><b>Use your school's alumni network</b></p>
    <p>Most campuses, usually through their career services or alumni offices, work hard to establish and maintain contacts with alumni working in various organizations and industries. Consider contacting some alumni from your school to check into internships in their places of employment. You'd be surprised by how strong the fellow alum tie can be.</p>

    <p><b>Tap into the resources of your own family, friends and acquaintances</b></p>
    <p>Does your mother's company have an internship program? Does your sister's friend's nonprofit organization offer any internship possibilities? Many college students don't think to ask their family members, friends and acquaintances to help them with career-related tasks like internship hunting. Be sure you don't fall into this trap.</p>

    <p><b>Page through an internship directory</b></p>
    <p>If you stop by your school's career services or campus library, or spend some time browsing in your campus or local bookstore, you'll undoubtedly find one or more internship directories listing internship programs at organizations around the US. Several companies publish these guides, including Peterson's Internships 2005 and The Internship Bible, 10th Edition. These books are typically well indexed so you can search for internships by organization, field of interest and geographic location.</p>

    <p>Once you've developed a list of internships, you can work with a career counselor to ready yourself for the important tasks to follow. Among them: developing and writing a resume and cover letter, learning how to follow up with prospective internship providers to keep yourself in the front of their minds, and preparing for internship interviews.</p>

    <p>With time and diligence, your efforts will pay off in an internship that gives you the experience you need to land the future job you want.</p>

    <p><b>What skills are required in general?</b></p>

    <p>Below are the top 10 skills employers want in an intern:</p>

    <ol>
    	<li>
    		<p><b>Communication</b></p>
    		<p>Communication occurs in a variety of ways, but future employers are primarily interested in your ability to write and speak professionally. You have the opportunity to demonstrate your written skills in your resume and cover letter, and your verbal skills as you supply thoughtful answers to the common interview questions you’ll likely be asked. During your interview, you might mention your experience giving oral presentations (which perhaps was required in some of your classes). The ability to communicate effectively — to translate ideas and convey information — is key in any field, whether it’s with your supervisor, coworkers, or clients, and employers are well aware that it is a valuable skill.</p>
    	</li>
    	<li><p><b>Interpersonal</b></p></li>
    	<p>The ability to communicate effectively is often related to one’s ability to relate well to others, or “people skills.” Depending on the industry, you may be interacting with clients and vendors as well as your co-workers and managers. It’s important to be able to build and maintain relationships and be the kind of person team members want in the office with them every day. Interpersonal skills are also important because employers seek individuals who can identify the wants and needs of others and who can recognize and acknowledge the value of differing perspectives.</p>

    	<li><p><b>Collaboration</b></p></li>
    	<p>As an intern, you’ll likely collaborate with other interns and company employees. Your ability to communicate and relate well to others is certainly important for collaboration, as is the capacity to work with others toward a common goal. As part of a team, you have to understand your own strengths and weaknesses so you know how you can best contribute, as well as be aware of how you can bring out the best in others.</p>

    	<li><p><b>Time Management</b></p></li>
    	<p>If you’ve managed to successfully take a full course load every semester and meet assignment deadlines, to some extent, you’ve already demonstrated time management skills. But as an intern, you’re not going to have a syllabus to tell you when your deadlines are. It’s up to you to organize your time and produce results. Employers want to know that you can prioritize responsibilities and recognize when it’s appropriate to multitask or focus on one particular project at a time.</p>

    	<li><p><b>Adaptability</b></p></li>
    	<p>Today’s work culture — whether you’re hoping to intern for a startup or well-established organization — often requires even the most senior level executives to wear multiple hats. As an intern, one day you might find yourself supporting the sales team and the next day performing customer service. While you may have an interest in a particular aspect of an industry, a willingness to become familiar with the different parts of an organization is definitely viewed as an asset (and also increases your exposure within the company).</p>

    	<li><p><b>Critical Thinking</b></p></li>
    	<p>Critical thinking refers to your ability to analyze and evaluate a situation or issue and form a judgment. The tendency to think critically can be demonstrated by a willingness to ask questions in order to understand an issue from all possible angles, and to pose creative solutions to challenges. It’s something many of your professors have likely emphasized and is highly valued by employers.</p>

    	<li><p><b>Research and Analysis</b></p></li>
    	<p>If you’ve completed any research papers or projects for your coursework (and you likely have), you already have experience with research and analysis. Don’t be shy during your interview for an internship; make it a point to bring up the empirical research you performed for your psychology class and the conclusions you came to about how your fellow students make purchasing decisions in the campus bookstore. As a new member of the organization, you’ll be hit with a lot of new information, and your ability to process that information is a testament to your ability to fulfill whatever role you’re assigned.</p>

    	<li><p><b>Initiative</b></p></li>
    	<p>You’ve applied for an internship to gain knowledge of an industry and professional experience, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have anything to offer. During your interview, highlight instances where you’ve taken it upon yourself to contribute or positively affect change. Your potential employer will appreciate the chance to bring someone on board who doesn’t have to wait to receive direction for every task, and who’s willing to assist others with their work</p>

    	<li><p><b>Receptiveness</b></p></li>
    	<p>While taking initiative is important, so is the ability to receive feedback. For example, if you’re asked about a time you made a mistake, you can mention the feedback you received regarding the error and how you responded to it. Your interviewer will want to know that you’re willing and able to address any weaknesses.</p>

       <li><p><b>Receptiveness</b></p></li>
       <p>You certainly won’t be expected to be an expert in whatever platform the company you’re applying to uses, particularly if you’re hoping to intern for a company within a highly specialized industry. But you should know your way around a computer, and your ability to navigate basic productivity software will likely be presumed</p>
